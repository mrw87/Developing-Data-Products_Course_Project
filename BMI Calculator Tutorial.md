**What IS BMI?**

According to the National Institutes of Health, BMI is a useful measure of overweight and obesity that is calculated from your height and weight. BMI is an estimate of body fat and a good gauge of your risk for diseases that can occur with more body fat. Specifically, a high BMI can increase your risk for certain diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones, breathing problems, and certain cancers.

As useful as this measure is, there are some exceptions to its efficacy: 

    -It may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build.

    -It may underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have lost muscle.
